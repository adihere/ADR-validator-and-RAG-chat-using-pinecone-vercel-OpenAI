2024-11-08T20:40:56.912Z: Response data: {"result":"# Title\nAdoption of AWS S3 for File Storage Instead of On-Premise Storage\n\n## Status\nProposed\n\n## Context\nOur current file storage solution relies on on-premise servers. This has led to limitations in terms of scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. As our data storage needs continue to grow, it is necessary to consider cloud-based solutions that can address these issues.\n\n## Decision\nWe will migrate our file storage solution from our on-premise servers to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3). This will enable us to leverage the benefits of cloud storage, including improved scalability, accessibility, and cost-efficiency.\n\n## Consequences\nBy adopting AWS S3, we can expect the following consequences:\n\n**Positive Consequences**\n1. **Scalability:** AWS S3 offers virtually unlimited storage with the ability to scale up or down based on our needs.\n2. **Accessibility:** AWS S3 provides global access to files, allowing remote teams to seamlessly access data.\n3. **Cost-Efficiency:** With AWS S3, we only pay for the storage we use, eliminating the need for significant upfront hardware investments and ongoing maintenance costs associated with on-premise servers.\n\n**Negative Consequences**\n1. **Migration Effort:** Shifting from on-premise to AWS S3 will require an initial effort to migrate existing files and integrate our systems with S3.\n2. **Dependency:** Relying on a third-party provider increases our dependency and may introduce risks in case of provider outages or changes in service terms.\n3. **Security and Compliance:** While AWS provides robust security measures, storing sensitive data on the cloud could potentially expose us to additional security risks. We will need to ensure our usage of S3 complies with all relevant data protection regulations.\n\n## References\n- [Amazon: AWS Prescriptive Guidance: ADR Process](https://aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/)\n- [GitHub: ADR GitHub organization](https://github.com/adrs)\n- [RedHat: Why you should use ADRs](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-an-architecture-decision-record-adr)\n- [AWS S3 Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\n  \nThis ADR will be committed to our git repo in the `adr` directory with the filename `adopt-aws-s3.md`."}
