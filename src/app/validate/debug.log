2024-11-04T13:34:13.992Z: Response data: {"result":"# Title\nReplace MySQL Database with PostgreSQL\n\n## Status\nProposed\n\n## Context\nWe are currently using MySQL as our primary database for the software project. However, we have started to encounter limitations with MySQL, especially in terms of performance, scalability, and advanced features. These limitations have started impacting the performance of our application negatively. Therefore, we are considering replacing MySQL with PostgreSQL.\n\n## Decision\nAfter evaluating multiple database options, we have decided to replace MySQL with PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL offers several advantages including better performance, scalability, and advanced features like full-text search, JSON support, and spatial queries. In addition, PostgreSQL is open-source and has a strong community support, reducing our dependency on a single vendor.\n\n## Consequences\nThe decision to replace MySQL with PostgreSQL has several consequences:\n\nPositive:\n1. Improved performance: PostgreSQL is known for its superior performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.\n2. Scalability: PostgreSQL has better support for scalability and can handle a larger number of concurrent users, which is crucial for our growing user base.\n3. Advanced features: PostgreSQL supports advanced SQL features like full-text search, JSON support, and spatial queries, which will help us in building richer and more interactive applications.\n\nNegative:\n1. Migration cost: The process of migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL will require significant effort and resources. This includes data migration, rewriting queries, and retraining staff.\n2. Potential downtime: Depending on the size of our database and the complexity of the migration process, there might be some downtime during the migration.\n\n## References\n1.

2024-11-04T13:34:24.910Z: Response data: {"result":"# Title\nReplace MySQL Database with PostgreSQL\n\n## Status\nProposed\n\n## Context\nOur current software project is using MySQL as the primary database. However, we have found that MySQL is not able to efficiently handle the increasing load and complex queries that our application requires. Additionally, MySQL lacks some advanced features like full join and partial index that our application could benefit from. After researching potential alternatives, PostgreSQL has emerged as a strong candidate due to its robustness, scalability, and feature set.\n\n## Decision\nWe propose to replace MySQL with PostgreSQL for our primary database. This decision involves migrating all current data from MySQL to PostgreSQL, and updating all database interactions in our software application to ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL. We will also need to update our database maintenance and backup strategies to accommodate PostgreSQL.\n\n## Consequences\nPositive Consequences:\n1. Improved Performance: PostgreSQL is more powerful and efficient at processing complex queries and can better handle high loads.\n2. Advanced Features: PostgreSQL supports full join, partial index, and other advanced SQL features that MySQL does not.\n3. Open Source: PostgreSQL is open source which could lead to reduced costs.\n\nNegative Consequences:\n1. Migration Effort: All current data will need to be migrated from MySQL to PostgreSQL, which will require significant effort.\n2. Compatibility Issues: There may be some compatibility issues during the transition which could lead to temporary outages or bugs.\n3. Learning Curve: The team needs to learn PostgreSQL if they are not familiar with it, which could slow down the development process initially.\n\n## References\n* PostgreSQL official website: https://www.postgresql.org/\n* MySQL vs PostgreSQL: A Comparative Study: https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/postgresql-vs-mysql/\n* Migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL: https://severalnines.com/database-blog/migrating-mysql-postgresql-what-you-should-know\n"}

2024-11-04T15:32:04.939Z: Response data: {"result":"# Transition from Excel to Microsoft Power BI for Reporting System\n\n## Status\nProposed\n\n## Context\nThe current reporting system in our organization is heavily reliant on excel sheets. While this method has served us well in the past, it has several limitations especially in handling large volumes of data, data visualization, and real-time data analysis. The need to evolve our reporting system to keep up with increasing data complexity and volume is apparent. After extensive research and analysis, Microsoft Power BI has been identified as a potential solution. \n\n## Decision\nWe will transition from using excel sheets for our reporting system to using Microsoft Power BI. We will establish a team that will be responsible for the migration process and will ensure that all employees are properly trained on how to use the new system. The transition process will be gradual to allow for the resolution of any issues that may arise and to minimize disruption to our operations.\n\n## Consequences\nPositive Consequences:\n1. Enhanced Data Visualization: Power BI provides advanced data visualization capabilities that will help our team to analyze data more efficiently.\n2. Real-Time Data Analysis: Power BI allows for real-time data analysis which will enable us to make decisions based on the most current data.\n3. Scalability: Power BI can handle larger data sets compared to excel which will be beneficial as our data needs continue to grow.\n4. Integration: Power BI seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft products we already use.\n\nNegative Consequences:\n1. Training: There will be a need for training employees on how to use Power BI which may require time and resources.\n2. Costs: Power BI comes with additional costs compared to excel.\n\n## References\n1.

2024-11-04T15:55:35.897Z: Response data: {"result":"# Title\nTransition from Excel Sheets to Microsoft Power BI for Reporting System\n\n## Status\nProposed\n\n## Context\nThe current reporting system relies heavily on Excel sheets. While Excel has served us well in the past, it lacks certain aspects needed for more complex data analysis and visualization. Furthermore, as the business scales, the volume of data is increasing, making it difficult to manage and process data using Excel. Hence, we must consider an advanced tool to cater to our growing need for sophisticated data processing and visual reporting. \n\n## Decision\nAfter considering various options, we have decided to transition our reporting system to Microsoft Power BI. Power BI is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities. It provides tools to transform, analyze, and visualize data. \n\n## Consequences\nTransitioning to Microsoft Power BI will have both positive and negative consequences.\n\nPositive Consequences:\n1. Enhanced Data Visualization: Power BI provides rich data visualization capabilities, which will allow us to create interactive reports and dashboards.\n2. Better Data Analysis: Power BI has built-in machine learning features, the ability to create custom algorithms, and integration with Azure Machine Learning.\n3. Integration: Power BI integrates seamlessly with existing Microsoft products, reducing the learning curve for employees and ensuring smoother data management.\n\nNegative Consequences:\n1. Learning Curve: There will be an initial learning curve for employees who are used to working with Excel. Training will be required to get them up to speed with Power BI.\n2. Cost: Power BI entails a subscription cost, unlike Excel which is usually part of the Microsoft Office Suite package most companies already have.\n\n## References\n- Microsoft Power BI: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/\n- Transitioning from Excel to Power BI: https://www.bluegranite.com/blog/transitioning-from-excel-to-power-bi-a-4-step-guide\n\n## How to start using ADRs with tools\nWe will use git for maintaining our ADRs.
