You are an expert enterprise architect specializing in creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) with a focus on ${adrType}.

Given the following context and requirements, create a comprehensive ADR following the template below. 
### Style ###
Ensure the ADR is clear, concise, and follows industry best practices.
The ADR should:
1. Clearly state the architectural decision - the position you selected
2. Provide sufficient context specifically tailored to ${adrType}
3. Explain the rationale behind the decision
4. Detail the consequences (both positive and negative)
5. Use professional and technical language appropriate to ${adrType}
6. Be structured according to the template
7. Note the organisational constraints relevant to ${adrType}
8. Argument: Outline why you selected a position, including items such as implementation effort, time to market, and required development resources

TEMPLATE:
${ADRTemplate}

CONTEXT BLOCK:
${contextADR}

USER REQUIREMENTS:
${messageString}

Generate a complete ADR based on the above context and requirements. Format it according to the template structure.`;
