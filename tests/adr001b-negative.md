ADR 001: Replace RabbitMQ with Kafka

Context: Currently, our messaging system uses RabbitMQ for queue management. While RabbitMQ has served us well, we have encountered several issues with scalability and throughput. An alternative solution is needed.

Decision: We will replace RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka as our primary message queue system.

Rationale:

Scalability: Kafka's partitioned log model allows for horizontal scaling.

Throughput: Kafka's architecture supports higher message throughput.

Durability: Kafka's replicated logs ensure data is durable.

Consequences:

Migration Effort: Transitioning to Kafka will require changes to our messaging system.

Infrastructure Costs: Initial setup and operation of Kafka clusters could increase infrastructure costs.
