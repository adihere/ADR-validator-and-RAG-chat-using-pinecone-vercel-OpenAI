ADR 001: Replace RabbitMQ with Kafka

Context: Currently, our messaging system uses RabbitMQ for queue management. While RabbitMQ has served us well, we have encountered several issues with scalability, throughput, and maintenance complexity. With increasing demand for real-time data processing and larger message volumes, an alternative solution is needed.

Decision: We will replace RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka as our primary message queue system.

Rationale:

Scalability: Kafka's partitioned log model allows for horizontal scaling with ease, handling higher loads without significant performance drops.

Throughput: Kafka's architecture supports higher message throughput, making it more suitable for our growing data volume and real-time processing needs.

Durability: Kafka's replicated logs ensure data is durable and fault-tolerant, reducing the risk of data loss.

Ecosystem Integration: Kafka's robust ecosystem with tools like Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams provides better integration with our existing data processing pipelines.

Community and Support: Kafka has a strong community and commercial support (e.g., Confluent), ensuring ongoing improvements and a wealth of resources for troubleshooting and optimization.

Consequences:

Migration Effort: Transitioning to Kafka will require significant changes to our messaging system, including updates to message producers, consumers, and monitoring systems.

Learning Curve: Teams will need training to effectively utilize Kafka, which might temporarily slow down development.

Infrastructure Costs: Initial setup and operation of Kafka clusters could increase infrastructure costs due to resource requirements.

Status: Approved
